____
#### Provides classes allowing you to print a C1FlexGrid using C1PrintDocument.
____
Note that this sample replaces the C1FlexGridPrintable sample.

This sample provides a C1FlexGridPrinter library that allows you to print, Preview,
or export a C1FlexGrid using the C1PrintDocument component (which is a part of the ComponentOne Reports for WinForms product).

The subdirectories included in this sample contain:

* C1FlexGridPrinter: the C1FlexGridPrinter class library itself; Build
    the library and reference it in your project, or include the
    C1FlexGridPrinter project itself in your solution, to access the
    printing functionality.

* Test1: an integrated test that allows you to print preview grids
    included in various C1FlexGrid samples. Some of the samples print
    the grid "as is" via the C1FlexGridPrinter class, while in others
    the standard C1FlexGrid is replaced with C1FlexGridPrintable2 to
    provide advanced features such as printing owner-drawn cells, and so on.

See readme.txt files within subdirectories for more details.
