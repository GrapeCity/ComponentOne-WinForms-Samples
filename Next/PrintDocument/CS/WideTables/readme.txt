WideTables
----------------------------------------
Shows how to create wide tables spanning several pages

The sample demonstrates the feature of C1PrintDocument which allows to render wide objects spanning multiple pages horizontally.
To enable this feature, the object's CanSplitHorz property should be set to true.
The preview is also adjusted to better show wide objects (margins are hidden, the gap between pages set to zero, and the end user is prevented from showing the margins).
