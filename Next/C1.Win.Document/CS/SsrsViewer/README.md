#### Demonstrates to use C1FlexViewer to view SSRS reports
____
This sample shows how the C1SSRSDocumentSource component can be used with C1FlexViewer to browse the reports tree available on a SSRS server, and to preview individual reports.

The code connects to a sample SSRS server provided by ComponentOne.
Adjust the C1SSRSDocumentSource's properties to connect to a different report server (such as one provided by your company for example).
