      Represents an extension of the LineMarker for the FlexChart.

      The LineMarker consists of a text area with content reflecting data point values, and an optional vertical or horizontal line (or both for a cross-hair effect) positioned over the plot area. It can be static (interaction = None), follow the mouse or touch position (interaction = Move), or move when the user drags the line (interaction = Drag).
