#### Render sample reports which use the Map custom field
____
The sample renders and previews several sample reports demonstrating the Map custom field.
The reports were created using the report designer application, and are located in the Maps.flxr file.

Note, some reports in the Maps.flxr file use external service (Google) to obtain geographical coordinates of objects.
This may take a VERY LONG TIME the first time a report runs.
After that, the geographical data is cached in a file in the binary directory called "geocache.xml", so subsequent runs of the same report should be much faster.
The pre-generated geocache.xml file may be deployed with a report if needed.
