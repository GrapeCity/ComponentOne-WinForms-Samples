 <!-- You have to use <br> or <p> to start lines. -->

<p>
 <!-- <P> is a "paragraph" marker.  Skip a line and start a new one. -->

Examples of
various type
sizes:
 <!-- Note this is on three lines; what does it look like in Netscape? -->

<br>
 <!-- Line break.  Start a new line on the page -->

<h1>
 <!-- it doesn't matter whether it's capital or lower-case -->

This is &#60;H1&#62;
 <!-- "<" is ASCII number 60, and ">" is ASCII number 62 -->
 <!-- If you want to SHOW them, instead of USE them, you -->
 <!-- have to quote them by number; otherwise they'll mean something -->
 <!-- You use "&#" before the number and ";" after it to quote it. -->

</h1>
 <!-- Stop the large print -->

<h2>This is &#60;H2&#62;</h2>
<h3>This is &#60;H3&#62;</h3>
<h4>This is &#60;H4&#62;</h4>
 <!-- More examples of type sizes. Note that these break lines. -->

Now we're back to ordinary-size type.  All type can be made
<i>italic</i>,
<b>boldface</b>, or
<b><i>boldface italic</i></b>.
<p>

The marker &#60;b&#62; or &#60;B&#62; starts <b>boldface</b>, and
the marker &#60;/b&#62; or &#60;/B&#62; ends it.
<p>

The marker &#60;i&#62; or &#60;I&#62; starts <i>italic</i>, and
&#60;/i&#62; or &#60;/I&#62; ends it.
<p>
Use both together: &#60;i&#62;&#60;b&#62; to do <i><b>bold italic</i></b>;
and close both (in either order) &#60;/b&#62;&#60;/I&#62; to
end it.
<p>

(This all assumes you know <b><i>why</b></i> you'd want to use either
one, of course;<br>
knowing how to use HTML is <b>not</b> a substitute for knowing how to
write.)<p>

HTML is very handy for making lists. There are several types:

<ol>
 <!-- ordered  list starts here -->

This is an "ordered list", using numbers.
 <!-- Note that this line is indented like the list, but has no bullet -->

<li>The HTML marker to begin an <b>ordered</b> list is <b>&#60;OL&#62;</b>
<li>Unsurprisingly, the marker to end it is <b>&#60;/ol&#62;</b>
<li>Each numbered item starts with <b>&#60;li&#62;</b> (for "List Item")
<li>You <b><i>don't</i></b> have to put in the number
<li>Not only that, you can't change it. Numbering is automatic.
</ol>

<ul>
 <!-- Unordered list starts here -->

This is an "unordered list", using "bullets".
 <!-- Note that this line is indented like the list, but has no bullet -->

<li>The HTML marker to begin an <b>UNordered</b> list is <b>&#60;UL&#62;</b>
<li>The marker to end it is <b>&#60;/ul&#62;</b>
<li>Each "bullet point" also starts with <b>&#60;li&#62;</b>
</ul>
 <!-- Unordered list ends here -->

<dl>
 <!-- "Directory list" starts here -->

There is also a "Directory List", which is useful for defining terms, and
various other situations where you might want two levels of indentation.

<dt>The HTML marker to begin a <b>Directory</b> list is <b>&#60;DL&#62;</b>
 <!-- This is a "term" marker, the usual list item mark -->

<dd>... and it ends with <b>&#60;/dl&#62;</b>
 <!-- This is a "definition" marker, useful for many purposes -->

<dt>There are <b>two</b> types of item codes:
<ol>
 <!-- This is an ordered list to enumerate the types -->
 <!-- note that a list can be embedded inside another list  -->

<li><b>&#60;DT&#62;</b>, which stands for "Directory Term"
<li><b>&#60;DD&#62;</b>, which stands for "Directory Definition"</ol>

<dt>Note that a Directory list doesn't <i><b>look</i></b> like a list;

<dd><b>&#60;DT&#62;</b> skips a line, but doesn't indent, and doesn't make a blank line, while

<dd><b>&#60;DD&#62</b> skips a line and indents; if you happen to have
a very long line (like this one) that would wrap around, the new line is
lined up indented.
 <!-- You can have several <DD>'s in a row under one <DT> -->

<dt>The <b>&#60;DD&#62;</b> mark was intended to be a "definition" of the
term, <dd>but it's good for lots of other things.

<dt>Netscape's "Bookmark" list is an HTML file, formatted using
<b>&#60;DL&#62;</b>;<dd>most of the "Hot List" pages on the Web started off
being bookmark files.

<dt>There is no automatic "bullet" with list items in a Directory List, but

<dt><li>if you want a bullet to appear, you can use <b>&#60;li&#62;
<i>after</i> &#60;dt&#62;</b>, like this

<dd><li>or <b><i>after</i></b> <b>&#60;dd&#62;</b>, like this

<li><dt>But ... <b><i>this</i></b> is what happens if you put <b>&#60;LI&#62;
<i>before</i> &#60;DT&#62;</b>

<li><dd>and this is what happens with <b>&#60;LI&#62; <i>before</i>
&#60;DD&#62;</b>, so be CAREFUL.

</dl>
 <!-- end directory list  -->

All kinds of lists start and end with implicit Paragraph marks.<p>

All of the marks above are just text formatting commands -- the sort
of thing any wordprocessor does; but the real power of HTML, and the Web
generally, lies in <b>HyperText</b>, that is, the ability to link one
page to another so that it becomes a "hot link". These are the blue,
underlined text pieces that you click on.  They're called "anchors" in
HTML, and they use the <b>&#60;A ...&#62; ... &#60;/A&#62;</b> marker.<p>

<a name="link.how"> </a>
A link like the following one to my home page: <A href="http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/">John Lawler</a>
looks like this in HTML:<br>
<dd><b>&#60;A href="http://www.umich.edu/~jlawler/"&#62;John Lawler&#60;/A&#62;</b>
<p>
<ul>This consists of the following parts:
<li>It begins with the mark "<b>&#60;A</b>", <b><i>followed by at least one
space or blank line</i></b>,
<li>followed by "<b>href</b>" (for "Hypertext REFerence"), <b><i>with NO
spaces</i></b>,
<li>followed by "<b>=</b>" (the "equal sign"), <b><i>with NO spaces</i></b>,
<li>followed by the URL typed out, <b>surrounded with DOUBLE quotes, <i>and NO spaces</b></I>,
<li>and terminated with "&#62;", <b><i>and NO spaces</i></b>,
<li>followed by whatever text you want to be blue and underlined<br>
(i.e, the link name itself; this can be as long as you want and can
have spaces in it),
<li>and ending with the mark <b>&#60;/A&#62;</b>.
</ul>

Any URL can be linked this way.  Clicking on it will go to that page,
just as if you had typed it into Netscape, or "opened" it from a menu.
