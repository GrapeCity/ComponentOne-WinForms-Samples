* CustomColumns.
  Demonstrates an example of the CustomFieldColumn class usage. This sample adds the special custom column (Actual Cost) that is calculated as a full cost of the resource multiplied by the amount of the resource usage.
  The value in the "Actual Cost" column is recalculated each time when any of its source values (such as resource cost or task duration) is changed.

  Replaces the standard Task Information dialog with a custom Form. This sample shows how to customize the Task Information dialog by handling C1GanttView.ShowDialog event.

  This sample represents how to create the custom filters by combining various existent filters or using advanced filter with multiple conditions.
  To apply custom filters, simply click to the buttons on the left side of form. When editing or viewing the project, you could use those filters to view the wanted tasks in separation.
