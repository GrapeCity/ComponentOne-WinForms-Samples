#### FlexGrid Selection and Aggregation Features
____
This sample demonstrates three powerful features of the FlexGrid control: ClipboardCopyMode, SelectionMode, and Aggregate functions.

The application showcases how to:
- Copy and paste data between grids with different clipboard copy modes (DataOnly, DataAndColumnHeaders, DataAndRowHeaders, DataAndAllHeaders, or Disabled)
- Use various selection modes including Default, Cell, CellRange, Row, RowRange, Column, ColumnRange, ListBox, MultiRange, and Checkbox
- Apply aggregate functions (Sum, Average, Count, CountDistinct, Max, Min, Sample/Population Variance, and Sample/Population Standard Deviation) on selected cells
- Search and highlight data across both source and destination grids
- Display real-time aggregate calculations in a dedicated panel
