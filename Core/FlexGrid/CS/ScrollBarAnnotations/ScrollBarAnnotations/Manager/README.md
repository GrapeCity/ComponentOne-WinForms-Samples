# Manager Folder

The `Manager` folder contains classes that handle high-level operations, orchestrate services, and implement business logic.
> **Note:** The Manager folder usually includes functionality that is **not part of the core sample logic** but is needed for coordinating features, integrating APIs, or managing shared resources.
