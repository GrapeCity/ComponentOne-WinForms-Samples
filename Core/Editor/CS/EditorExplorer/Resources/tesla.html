    <p>
        Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was an inventor and a mechanical 
        and electrical engineer.</p>
    <p>Tesla was born in the village of Smiljan near the town 
        of Gospić, Vojna Krajina, in the territory of today&#39;s Croatia. He was an ethnic 
        Serb subject of the Austrian Empire and later became an American citizen.</p>
    <p>Tesla is often described as an important scientist and inventor of the modern 
        age, a man who &quot;shed light over the face of Earth&quot;. He is best known for many 
        revolutionary contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the 
        late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
    <p>Tesla&#39;s patents and theoretical work formed 
        the basis of modern alternating current electric power (AC) systems, including 
        the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor, with which he helped 
        usher in the Second Industrial Revolution. After his demonstration of wireless 
        communication (radio) in 1894 and after being the victor in the &quot;War of 
        Currents&quot;, he was widely respected as one of the greatest electrical engineers 
        who worked in America.</p>
    <p>Much of his early work pioneered modern electrical 
        engineering and many of his discoveries were of groundbreaking importance. 
        During this period, in the United States, Tesla&#39;s fame rivaled that of any other 
        inventor or scientist in history or popular culture, but due to his eccentric 
        personality and his seemingly unbelievable and sometimes bizarre claims about 
        possible scientific and technological developments, Tesla was ultimately 
        ostracized and regarded as a mad scientist.</p>
    <p>Never having put much focus on 
        his finances, Tesla died impoverished at the age of 86. The SI unit measuring 
        magnetic flux density or magnetic induction (commonly known as the magnetic 
        field &quot;B&quot;), the tesla, was named in his honor (at the Conférence Générale des 
        Poids et Mesures, Paris, 1960), as well as the Tesla effect of wireless energy 
        transfer to wirelessly power electronic devices which Tesla demonstrated on a 
        low scale (lightbulbs) as early as 1893 and aspired to use for the 
        intercontinental transmission of industrial energy levels in his unfinished 
        Wardenclyffe Tower project.</p>
    <p>Aside from his work on electromagnetism and 
        electromechanical engineering, Tesla has contributed in varying degrees to the 
        establishment of robotics, remote control, radar and computer science, and to 
        the expansion of ballistics, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics. In 
        1943, the Supreme Court of the United States credited him as being the inventor 
        of the radio. Many of his achievements have been used, with some controversy, 
        to support various pseudosciences, UFO theories, and early New Age occultism. 
        Tesla is honored in Serbia and Croatia, as well as in the Czech Republic and 
        Romania. He was awarded the highest order of the White Lion by Czechoslovakia.</p>
