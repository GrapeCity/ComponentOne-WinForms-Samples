TagsSample
----------------------------------------
Shows how to use custom tags in C1PrintDocument.

The sample shows how tags can be used to create easily parameterized documents, or documents with content that needs to be updated after the document has been created.
E.g. if the document is a list of items, totals for all items can be printed at the top of the document.
In this sample a directory listing is produced, and the total number of files and directories is printed at the top.
