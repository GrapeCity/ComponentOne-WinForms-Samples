#### Demonstrates the style property CharWidth
____
This sample demonstrates the style property CharWidth that allows to control the widths of characters within text. 

This property specifies the width value in percent relative to normal width. The default is 100. Setting this property to 200 for example makes characters twice as wide as they are normally. 

Note that this feature works only if UseGdiPlusTextRendering on the C1PrintDocument is set to false, otherwise this property is ignored.
