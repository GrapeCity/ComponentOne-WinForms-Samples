#### Shows how to attach a "sticky note" to an object in a C1PrintDocument
____
This sample is based on the "ObjectsCoordinates" sample (which shows how to find and highlight a RenderObject under the mouse in the preview). 

In addition to that, the current sample allows the end user to enter a short text associated with the highlighted object, and then creates a RenderText with the entered text (the "sticky note") and adds it to the document placing it near the original highlighted object. The document is then regenerated with the "sticky note".
