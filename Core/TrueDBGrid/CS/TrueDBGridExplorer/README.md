## Note
ComponentOne TrueDBGrid is supported with .NET Core and .NET Framework. However, we are not actively developing new features for TrueDBGrid such as design-time features for newer versions of Visual Studio. You may use TrueDBGrid to develop and maintain existing applications, or to help migrate ActiveX applications using True DBGrid Pro 8.0 to .NET. 
**For new development we recommend using [ComponentOne FlexGrid](https://developer.mescius.com/componentone/docs/win/online-flexgrid/overview.html).**
