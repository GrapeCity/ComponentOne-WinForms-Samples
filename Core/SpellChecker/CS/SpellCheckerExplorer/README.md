SpellCheckerExplorer is the single source for you to learn about SpellChecker. 
It shows all the features of SpellChecker in an easy to explore hierarchy.

Included samples:

* QuickStart.
  Shows how to use the C1SpellChecker component to check different types of control. 
  The sample has tabs that select the type of control to spell-check: regular TextBox, RichTextBox, or C1FlexGrid. 
  The textboxes have built-in support for as-you-type as well as modal spell-checking.
  The C1FlexGrid shows how to implement modal spell-checking on arbitrary controls by implementing the ISpellCheckableEditor interface.
* WebBrowserSpell.
  C1SpellChecker supports controls based on the WebBrowser class.
  The support includes underlining errors with red-wavy underlines as you type, with suggestions in context-sensitive menus, and also the dialog-based modal spell-check.
