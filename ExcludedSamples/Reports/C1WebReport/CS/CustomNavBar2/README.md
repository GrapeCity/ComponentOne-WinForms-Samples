#### Create a custom navigation bar with 'goto page' and 'export' buttons (and Ajax support).
____
The C1WebReport control has a built-in navigation bar that you can use with paged reports. Just set the NavigationBar.Visible property to true, and customize its appearance with the NavigationBar.Style property. 

If the built-in navigation bar does not look or behave exactly the way you want it to, you can make it invisible and create your own. This sample creates a navigation bar inside a table cell. 

Custom navigation bars can also use callbacks to take advantage of Ajax. To do this, the page adds an onclick attribute to each button containing a javascript call that causes the callback.
