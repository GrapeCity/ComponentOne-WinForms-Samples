CommonTasks

CommonTasks

XML report definition files that show how to accomplish common reporting tasks using C1Report.

Load any of these files into the C1ReportDesigner to see how you
can easily implement reports with tables, subreports, multiple columns,
embedded images, subtotals, script-based formatting, and more.

The report definition files are language-independent. You can load them into 
C1Report controls at design or run time, in VB or C#, and create reports from
your programs. You can also open them in the C1ReportDesigner, edit them, 
and create reports from that application.

Or you can load these reports into the C1WebReport control to render the 
reports on your Web pages.
