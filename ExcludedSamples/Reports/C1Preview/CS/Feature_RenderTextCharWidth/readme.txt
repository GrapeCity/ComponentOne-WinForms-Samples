Feature_RenderTextCharWidth
---------------------------------------------------
Demonstrates the style property CharWidth

This sample demonstrates the style property CharWidth that allows
to control the widths of characters within text.

This property specifies the width value in percent relative to
normal width. The default is 100. Setting this property to 200
for example makes characters twice as wide as they are normally.

Note that this feature works only if UseGdiPlusTextRendering on
the C1PrintDocument is set to false, otherwise this property
is ignored.
