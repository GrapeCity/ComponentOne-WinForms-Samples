#### Show a Pdf report in a new browser window.
____
The ShowPDF method displays the report as a PDF document in the current browser window. 

In some cases you may want to show the Pdf report in a new window. To do that, you need to run some client-side script to open a new browser window. 

This has a client-side button with a window.open command that on the current URL but with a 'pdf=true' parameter that causes the page to show the Pdf report in the new page.
