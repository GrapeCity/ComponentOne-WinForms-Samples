ChartReport
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create reports with embedded charts, gradients, and bar code fields.

There is no code behind the report. The charts, gradients, and bar code were 
created with the Report Designer application and saved into a regular report 
definition file (nwindchrt.xml).

This sample uses the CustomFields sample assembly. To avoid conflicts between
versions of C1Report and C1Chart used by CustomFields, this sample includes
its own copy of that sample rather than referencing a pre-build assembly.
