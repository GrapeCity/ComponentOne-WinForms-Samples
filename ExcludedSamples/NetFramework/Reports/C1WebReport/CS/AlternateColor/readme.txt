AlternateColor
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the PrintSection event to customize formatting.

The sample uses the PrintSection event to change the formatting of 
the detail section of the report as it is rendered. 

In this sample, the PrintSection event handler toggles a variable and 
changes the background color of the detail section, so detail sections 
are rendered in alternating colors.

The PrintSection event is also present in the C1Report component that is 
contained in the C1WebReport control.
