#### Use script properties to format the report based on its contents.
____
The sample uses a script property (OnPrint) to change properties in field objects as the report is rendered. 

The nice thing about this approach is that the formatting becomes part of the report, not the application. If you save the report and render it within another application, the formatting will still be applied.
