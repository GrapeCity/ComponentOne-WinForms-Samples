CustomPaperSize
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create reports that use custom paper sizes.

Custom paper sizes are useful not only when creating 
actual printed reports on custom paper, but also when you 
want to export to PDF, HTML, and RTF formats and would
like control over the size of the pages.

You can do this by assigning a custom paper size directly to 
the PrintDocument object (returned by C1Report Document 
property), or by setting the Layout.CustomWidth and 
Layout.CustomHeight properties.
