# ComponentOne WinForms Edition Samples 

Deliver intuitive and beautiful Windows Forms applications in less time.

* Display and edit data with lightning-fast datagrids and input controls
* Endless data visualization options with flexible charts and reporting components

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne WinForms Edition](https://developer.mescius.com/componentone/winforms-ui-controls). There are several different projects that are organized in sub-folders. These sub-folders are organized similarly to the organization of the docs for .NET. Each sample has a readme.md file that explains the sample. 

The samples reference, but do not include, the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from nuget.org or developer.mescius.com/componentone.

## Building a Sample 

* .NET Framework samples require Visual Studio 2012 and above. 
* .NET 6 samples will require Visual Studio 2019 and above.

You can also build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). 
Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```

This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
