____
The sample demonstrates the use of the LineMarkers in the FlexChart.
A LineMarker displays the precise data values for a given position on the chart by dragging horizontal and/or vertical lines over the plot with an attached label.
It is useful in scenarios, where a user has a lot of data in a line or area chart, or if a user wants to display data from multiple series in a single label.
With built-in interactions, such as Drag and Move. a user can drag the line marker and more precisely select the data point on the chart.
