#### C1SpellChecker supports controls based on the WebBrowser class
____
Starting with version 2.0.20092.50, the C1SpellChecker component supports spell-checking of editors that derive from the standard WebBrower class. 

The support includes underlining errors with red-wavy underlines as you type, with suggestions in context-sensitive menus, and also the dialog-based modal spell-check. 

The methods used are the same as the ones used with TextBoxBase controls: 

- SetActiveSpellChecking turns as-you-type spell checking on or off, and 

- CheckControl performs a dialog-based modal check of the text in the control.
