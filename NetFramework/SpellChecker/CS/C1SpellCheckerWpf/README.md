#### Implements as-you-type spell-checking on a Wpf RichTextBox.
____
This sample shows how you can use the C1SpellChecker component to perform spell-checking on a WPF RichTextBox control. 

The sample listens to the TextChanged event and scans the text in the RichTextBox. Any misspellings found are underlined in red, and a context menu shows suggestions and spelling options. 

Note that the WPF RichTextBox has a built-in spell-checker, but that is not flexible enough for some applications. For example, the WPF RichTextBox does not allow you to customize the spell dictionaries. 

The C1SpellChecker allows you to customize dictionaries in any way you want, by adding custom words for example or defining entirely new dictionaries.
