C1SpellCheckerSpeed
----------------------------------------------------------------
Measures the C1SpellChecker performance when checking long documents.

The sample has three buttons that spell-check the novel Moby Dick,
the Declaration of Independence, and the King James Bible. After 
each document has been checked, the application shows the performance
measurements.

On typical machines, the C1SpellChecker can check over 400 thousand
words per second.
