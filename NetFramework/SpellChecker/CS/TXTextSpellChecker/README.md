#### Shows how to implement as-you-type spell-checking with the TXTextControl.

The TXTextControl is a very popular and powerful text editor control (http://www.textcontrol.com/). It supports advanced features like tables, doc and html file format import and export, pdf output, and more. 

The TXTextControl does not include a built-in spell checker. This sample shows how you can implement a control that derives from the TXTextControl and implements the interfaces required by the C1SpellChecker in order to support as-you-type spell-checking.
