The SyntaxEditor is a very popular and powerful text editor control (http://www.actiprosoftware.com/products/controls/windowsforms/syntaxeditor/). It supports advanced features syntax highlighting, IntelliPrompt UI, languages and more. 

The SyntaxEditor does not include a built-in spell checker. This sample shows how you can implement a class that wraps the SyntaxEditor and implements the interfaces required by the C1SpellChecker in order to support as-you-type spell-checking.
