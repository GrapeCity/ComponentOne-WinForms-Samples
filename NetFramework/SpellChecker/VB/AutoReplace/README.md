#### Shows how the AutoReplaceList property works.
____
AutoReplaceList contains a list of words and replacements. While the C1SpellChecker is monitoring a text box, it looks for matches against this list and automatically replaces them in the editor, as the user types. 

The sample shows a grid containing word/replacement pairs that is copied into the C1SpellChecker's AutoReplaceList. It also has a rich text box that is monitored by the C1SpellChecker. Typing any of the words on the list causes it to be replaced automatically.
