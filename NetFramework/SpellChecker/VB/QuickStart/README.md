#### Shows how to use the C1SpellChecker component to check different types of control.
____
The sample has tabs that select the type of control to spell-check: regular TextBox, RichTextBox, or C1FlexGrid. 

The textboxes have built-in support for as-you-type as well as modal spell-checking. 

The C1FlexGrid shows how to implement modal spell-checking on arbitrary controls by implementing the ISpellCheckableEditor interface.
