CustomBuiltInSpellDialog
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how you can customize the C1SpellChecker's built-in spell dialog.

The C1SpellChecker control has a built-in modal dialog used to display
spelling mistakes and allow users to correct them.

The sample creates an instance of the C1SpellDialog class, modifies
its properties, then passes the customized dialog in a call to the 
CheckControl method.
