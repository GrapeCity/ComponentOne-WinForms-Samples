#### Demonstrates how C1Themes change the look of a C1Ribbon-based application that uses various C1 controls.
____
This sample shows a C1RibbonForm-based form with a C1Ribbon UI and several C1 controls.
The ribbon includes a dropdown menu (on the right) that lists all built-in themes included with the C1ThemeController component, 
and allows to select a theme which is then assigned to the C1ThemeController.ApplicationTheme property (the same menu is also accessible via the ribbon's Quick Access Toolbar).

In addition to C1.Win.C1Themes.2 assembly, the sample uses the following C1 assemblies:

* C1.Win.C1Command.2
* C1.Win.C1FlexGrid.2
* C1.Win.C1GanttView.2
* C1.Win.C1Input.2
* C1.Win.C1Ribbon.2
* C1.Win.C1Schedule.2
* C1.Win.C1TrueDBGrid.2
It is recommended that you update all those assemblies to the latest available versions.
Theme support was added in our 2013v3 release so any versions older than that will not properly work with this sample.

While this sample uses .NET 2.0 versions of our assemblies, you can switch to the matching .NET 4.0 versions without any changes to the code 
(just change the target framework, C1 assembly references, and the corresponding assembly names in the licenses.licx file).
