ThemesEvents
---------------------------------------------------------------
Events of C1ThemeController

This sample demonstrates:
- how to allow the end user to select a theme at runtime;
- how to customize properties of controls after applying a theme.

In this sample the Font on lblApplicationTheme, and some style attributes of the 
EvenRowStyle on ctdbgThemes are set to predefined values in the 
ObjectThemeApplied event handler so that they persist across application theme 
changes.

The sample uses C1TrueDBGrid and C1Input controls, so you need to have those 
controls installed on your system (C1TrueDBGrid should be 2.0.20133.61334 or 
newer, C1Input 2.0.20133.33326 or newer).

While this sample uses .NET 2.0 versions of our assemblies, you can switch to 
the matching .NET 4.0 versions without any changes to the code (just change the 
target framework, C1 assembly references, and the corresponding assembly names 
in the licenses.licx file).
