#### Demonstrates how C1Themes change the look of a C1Ribbon-based application that uses various C1 controls.
____
This sample shows a C1RibbonForm-based application with a C1Ribbon UI and several C1 controls. The ribbon includes a dropdown menu (on the right) that lists all built-in themes included with the C1ThemeController component, and allows to select a theme which is then assigned to the C1ThemeController.ApplicationTheme property (the same menu is also accessible via the ribbon's Quick Access Toolbar). 

In addition to C1.Win.C1Themes.4 assembly, the sample uses the following C1 assemblies: 

- C1.Win.C1Command.4 - C1.Win.C1FlexGrid.4 - C1.Win.C1GanttView.4 - C1.Win.C1Input.4 - C1.Win.C1Ribbon.4 - C1.Win.C1Schedule.4 - C1.Win.C1TrueDBGrid.4
