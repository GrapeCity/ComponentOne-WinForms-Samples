ThemesEvents

How to use events of C1ThemeController

This sample demonstrates:
- how to allow the end user to select a theme at runtime;
- how to customize properties of controls after applying a theme.

In this sample the Font on lblApplicationTheme, and some style attributes of the 
EvenRowStyle on ctdbgThemes are set to predefined values in the 
ObjectThemeApplied event handler so that they persist across application theme 
changes.

The sample uses C1TrueDBGrid and C1Input controls.
