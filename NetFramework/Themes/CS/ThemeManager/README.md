This sample demonstrates how you can allow the end user to select a theme at runtime, and set it as the current theme for the whole application. 

The list of available themes is initially populated by the predefined themes shipped with the C1ThemeController component. The user can also add themes from .c1theme files to the running application. 

The sample uses C1TrueDBGrid and C1Input controls, so you need to have those controls installed on your system.
