Control Explorer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows most Studio for WinForms controls and lets users see them in action.

Points of interest:

1) The project takes advantage of the lighter .NET 4.0 Client Profile.

2) The project is driven by an xml resource file that lists the forms that should
be exposed by the sample.

3) The main form uses C1RibbonForm, C1DockingTab and C1TopicBar in its layout.

4) The application has a global visual style setting that applies to each demo.

5) Users can set specific properties using a C1InputPanel automatically generated 
for each demo.

6) The home page is HTML content with hyperlinks and images using C1SuperLabel.

7) The source code (C#) is zipped as an embedded resource and is rendered at run-
time using C1Zip and C1PrintDocument.

8) Users can uninstall the application through add/remove programs.
