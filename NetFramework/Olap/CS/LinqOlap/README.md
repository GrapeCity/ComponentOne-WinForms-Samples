#### Shows Northwind sales data.
____
This project uses a LINQ query to build a DataTable containing the NorthWind sales data, then uses this table as a data source for a C1OlapPage control. 

The C1OlapPage allows the user to see different views of the data, including an Olap grid and an Olap chart.
