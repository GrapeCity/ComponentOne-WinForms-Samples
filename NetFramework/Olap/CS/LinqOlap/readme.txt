LinqOlap
---------------------------------------------------------
Shows Northwind sales data.

This project uses a LINQ query to build a DataTable containing
the NorthWind sales data, then uses this table as a data source
for a C1OlapPage control.

The C1OlapPage allows the user to see different views of the 
data, including an Olap grid and an Olap chart.
