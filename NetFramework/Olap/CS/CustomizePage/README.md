#### Shows how you can customize the C1OlapPage control.
____
The sample creates a default view that is persisted across sessions, and it also adds a new menu to the C1OlapPage that contains a list of predefined views. 

The sample also shows how to implement Undo/Redo buttons that allow users to restore previous ViewDefinitions (note that undo/redo functionality was added to the C1OlapPage as a standard feature in build 2.0.20101.51).
