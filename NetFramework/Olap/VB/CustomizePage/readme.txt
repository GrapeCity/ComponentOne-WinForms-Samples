----------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how you can customize the C1OlapPage control.

The sample creates a default view that is persisted across sections,
and it also adds a new menu to the C1OlapPage that contains a list
of predefined views.

The sample also shows how to implement Undo/Redo buttons that allow 
users to restore previous ViewDefinitions.
