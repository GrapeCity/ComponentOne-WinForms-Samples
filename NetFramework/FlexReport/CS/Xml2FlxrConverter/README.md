#### Batch converter of C1Report .XML report definitions to FlexReport .FLXR format.
____
This sample allows the user to select one or more .XML files containing C1Report report definitions, and to convert them to the new FlexReport's .FLXR file format.

The reports are converted by loading them into FlexReport which automatically converts the legacy C1Report report definitions to the new format.
This duplicates the functionality of the FlexReport Designer App, but allows to convert multiple files in a single batch.
