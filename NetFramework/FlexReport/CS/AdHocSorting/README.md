The sample presents a list with report fields and sort direction buttons. Once the user makes a selection, it adds a SortDefinition to the report's main DataSource, and shows the report.

The sample assumes that the C1NWind.mdb sample database can be found at the following standard location: 

"c:\Users\<user name>\Documents\ComponentOne Samples\Common\C1NWind.mdb"
