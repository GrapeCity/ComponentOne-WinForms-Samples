AdHoc Sorting
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select the sorting criteria before rendering the report.

The sample presents a list with report fields and sort direction buttons.
Once the user makes a selection, it adds a SortDefinition to the report's main DataSource, and shows the report.

The sample report definition is stored within the report object on the form, but the sample also allows to pick an arbitrary report.

The sample assumes that the C1NWind.mdb sample database can be found at the following standard location:

"c:\Users\<user name>\Documents\ComponentOne Samples\Common\C1NWind.mdb"
