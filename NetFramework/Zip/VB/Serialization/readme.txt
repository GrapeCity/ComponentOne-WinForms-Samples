Serialization
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add compression to the .NET serialization support.

.NET serializable classes can be saved to and restored from streams.

This sample shows how you can add compression to these streams and reduce their size by 50-80%.
This is especially useful when serializing large objects such as DataSets and DataTables.
