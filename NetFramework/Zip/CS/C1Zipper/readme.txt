C1Zipper
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement a simple Zip utility.

The sample lets you create, open, and edit standard ZIP files.

You can list the entries in the zip file, add, remove, expand, or view files, compress whole directories, and use password protection.

Note: this is an updated version of the similar sample ZipFileDemo.
