#### Shows how you can define and use your own custom tags.
____
The C1Editor is not restricted to plain XHTML. You can define and use your own extensions by specifying a list of valid tags to be accepted by the editor. 

In this sample, custom tags are defined in the "customtags.xml" file. Once they are defined, custom tags can be used in the editor like any other regular XHTML tags. 

The "Statistics" button shows statistics on the use of custom tags. 

The design and preview appearances are defined in the "design.css" and "preview.css" files.
