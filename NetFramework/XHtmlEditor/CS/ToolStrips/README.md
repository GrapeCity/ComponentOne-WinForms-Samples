The sample shows the following: 1. C1EditorToolStripMain, C1EditorToolStripStyle, C1EditorToolStripTable, C1EditorToolStripObjects toolstrips; 2. A standard MS ToolStrip with some buttons of type C1EditorToolStripButton; 3. A custom MyToolStrip class, derived from C1EditorToolStripBase. 

These toolstrips interact with the C1Editor control.
