#### This sample demonstrates how you can customize the print and print preview features.
____
The print and print preview customization features available to the C1Editor rely on corresponding features exposed by the Microsoft Internet Explorer. 

The sample includes several print templates that can be selected using the drop-down list box above the browser window. The templates show how you can implement print preview features such as custom headers and footers, page setup, margins, and user interface controls. 

Click the Preview, Print with Prompt, or Print w/o Prompt buttons to open the preview window or print using the currently selected print template. 

Click the Template Source button to view the template's source code.
