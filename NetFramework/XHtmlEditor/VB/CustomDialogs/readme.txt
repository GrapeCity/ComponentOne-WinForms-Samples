CustomDialogs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Demonstrates how to create custom dialogs for:

- inserting/editing hyperlinks, bookmarks, picture, objects and tables; 
- implementing find/replace commands;
- implementing basic text formatting.

The C1Editor control contains built-in dialogs for all these tasks, but
on some occasions you may want to implement your own in order to customize
their appearance or behavior.
