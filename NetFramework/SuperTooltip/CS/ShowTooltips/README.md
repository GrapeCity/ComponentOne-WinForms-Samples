#### This sample compares the Show() and Hide() methods in the standard tooltip and C1SuperTooltip.
____
The Show() method allows you to display a tooltip at a specified position, for a specified amount of time. 

The standard ToolTip component has several overloads for this, all of which are also provided by the C1SuperTooltip. 

The C1SuperTooltip also has an additional set of overloads that allows you to associate tips with ToolStripItem objects (in addition to controls).
