SuperErrorProvider
------------------------------------------------------
This sample shows how to use the C1SuperErrorProvider component with data sources and individual controls.

C1SuperErrorProvider presents a simple mechanism for indicating to the end user that a control
or data field/column has an error associated with it. An icon appears next to the control with 
not empty error description text.

C1SuperErrorProvider works in conjunction with the C1SuperTooltip component that can display
HTML text for the error description.
