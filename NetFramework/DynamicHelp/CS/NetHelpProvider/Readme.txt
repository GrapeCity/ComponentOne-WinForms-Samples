NetHelpProvider
-----------------------------
Source code (part of the actual C1DynamicHelp source code) of one of the two built-in IHelpProvider interface implementations.

This code can be used as a reference implementation by developers who need to add support of a custom help format by providing their own implementation of the IHelpProvider interface (an advanced feature of C1DynamicHelp).
