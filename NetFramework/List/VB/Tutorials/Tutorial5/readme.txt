Using C1List with SQL Query Results.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use C1List to display the results of ad-hoc SQL queries.
In addition, it will also outline how to set up a connection to a DataSet at run-time.
Note that in order for the list to automatically respond to field layout changes, you must not have defined any column properties at design time.
If a layout is already defined, use the list's Clear Fields context menu command to remove it.
This will cause the list to configure itself automatically at run time.
