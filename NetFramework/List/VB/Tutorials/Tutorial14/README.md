#### Displaying Bitmaps.
____
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Style objects to display arbitrary bitmaps within list cells. In addition to font, color, and alignment settings, Style objects support both background and foreground pictures. Background pictures can be centered, tiled, or stretched to fill the entire cell. Foreground pictures can be positioned relative to the cell text, and can also be displayed using a transparent color.
