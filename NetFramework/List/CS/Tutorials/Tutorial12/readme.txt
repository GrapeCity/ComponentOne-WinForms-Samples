Creating Fixed, Nonscrolling Columns in List.

Often, you would like to prevent one or more columns from scrolling horizontally or vertically so that they will always be in view.
The SplitCollection of List provides a generalized mechanism for defining groups of adjacent columns, and can be used to implement any number of fixed, nonscrolling columns or rows.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to write code to create a list with two horizontal splits, and then "fix" a pair of columns in the leftmost split.
