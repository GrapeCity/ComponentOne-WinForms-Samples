This demos shows how InputFlowPanel can be used to manually design complex flexible layouts where fields are populated with data at runtime.

It shows that the InputFlowPanel component may be used for design flexible form with complicated layout implemented by runtime-generated InputGridPanel components filled with some data. The data may be received from databaze or application's resources.
