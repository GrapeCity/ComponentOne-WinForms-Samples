This sample shows an example of item's catalogue on C1InputPanel using the InputFlowPanel and InputGridPanel components.

It shows that the InputFlowPanel component may be used for design flexible form with complicated layout implemented by runtime-generated InputGridPanel components filled with some data. The data may be received from databaze or application's resources.
