There are two components based on InputControlHost: ColorEditorHost and FontEditorHost. They can be saved to XML and loaded from XML at runtime. ColorEditorHost is based on the standard Color UITypeEditor. It shows a form where the users can pick the color. FontEditorHost hosts the standard Font UITypeEditor and shows a form where the user can select the font.
