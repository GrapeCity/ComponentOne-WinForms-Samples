The C1SizerLight automatically resizes child controls when you resize the form, and usually doesn't require you to write any code. 

In some cases, however, you may want to prevent specific controls from having their fonts resized, or you may want to add, remove, and resize controls at runtime. This sample shows how you can do that.
