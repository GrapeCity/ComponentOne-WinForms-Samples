Light_Runtime
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control the C1SizerLight at runtime.

The C1SizerLight automatically resizes child controls when you resize 
the form, and usually doesn't require you to write any code.

In some cases, however, you may want to prevent specific controls from 
having their fonts resized, or you may want to add, remove, and resize
controls at runtime. This sample shows how you can do that.
