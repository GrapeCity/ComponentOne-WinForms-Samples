#### Shows how to add child controls to a C1Sizer using code.
____
The sample adds controls by creating them, adding them to the C1Sizer's Controls collection, then positioning them using the Bounds property available in the sizing grid's Row and Column objects. 

The sample positions the controls at specific cells by intersecting specific row and column rectangles. You can also make controls span any number of adjacent grid cells.
