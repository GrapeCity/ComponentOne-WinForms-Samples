CustomSplitters

Use the OnPaint event to customize the appearance of the splitter bars.

The sample uses the OnPaint event to add images and text to the C1Sizer splitter bars.

It also handles the mouse to collapse and expand splitter panes when the user clicks an icon on the left of the splitter bar.
