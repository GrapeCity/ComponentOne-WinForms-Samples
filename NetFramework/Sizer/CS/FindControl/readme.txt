FindControl
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how to determine which control is at a given grid cell.

The sample populates a C1Sizer control with buttons, using the GetCellBounds method to position them initially.

It then uses the GetControlAtCell method to find controls at each cell on the C1Sizer.
