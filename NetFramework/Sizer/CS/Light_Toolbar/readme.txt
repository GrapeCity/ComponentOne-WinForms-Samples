Light_Toolbar
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatically resize controls with a wrapping toolbar.

The samples shows how the C1SizerLight component works when the form has a wrapping toolbar docked to the top.

When you resize the form and cause the toolbar to wrap, reducing the form's client area, C1SizerLight takes that into account and resizes the child controls to the new client area.
