SizerTutorial2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Typical use of the C1Sizer grid mode.

The sample builds a dialog similar to the FileOpen dialog.

The resizing grid is setup so that when the dialog is resized, the ListView control on the center of the form resizes to fill most of the space, 
and other controls keep their height but are distributed over the new client area.
This sample is the second tutorial described in the manual.
