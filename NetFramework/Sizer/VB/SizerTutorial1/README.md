#### Simple use of the C1Sizer grid mode.
____
The sample shows a simple data-entry form with labels and data-entry controls that are resized automatically when the form is resized. 

The resizing grid is setup so that the width of the controls resizes proportionally with the form, but the height of most controls is kept fixed. 

This sample is the first tutorial described in the manual.
