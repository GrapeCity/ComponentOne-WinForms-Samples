#### The sample demonstrates a few layout options in a C1SplitContainer.
____
The main C1SplitContainer in this sample contains panels with absolute and relative size. There are resizable, collapsible, and fixed panels.
The panel control can display scrollbars working even at design-time.

In the nested split container you can see a panel with owner-drawn header and splitter.
When you move this splitter the panels are redrawn on-the-fly.
The bottom panel restricts its minimum height.
