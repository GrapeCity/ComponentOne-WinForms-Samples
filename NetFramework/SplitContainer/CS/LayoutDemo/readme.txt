LayoutDemo
-----------------------------
The sample demonstrates a few layout options in a C1SplitContainer.

The main C1SplitContainer in this sample contains panels with absolute and relative size.
There are resizable, collapsible, and fixed panels.
The panel control can display scrollbars working even at design-time.

In the nested split container you can see a panel with owner-drawn header and splitter.
When you move this splitter the panels are redrawn on-the-fly.
The bottom panel restricts its minimum height.
