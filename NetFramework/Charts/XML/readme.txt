Persisted Chart Samples
=======================
This sample contains persisted charts that can be loaded in default charts.

By saving complex charts to an XML file (or chart2dxml and chart3dxml) files,
it is possible to save many properties and chart data that can be set with
a single coded line using LoadChartFromFile() or LoadChartAndImagesFromFile()
methods.
