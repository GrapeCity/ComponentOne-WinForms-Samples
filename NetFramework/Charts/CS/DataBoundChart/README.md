#### Shows a 2D Horizontal Bar Chart using data from a database.
____
The sample creates a 2D horizontal bar chart that is loaded from a database.  The database, NWIND.MDB, assumed to be installed by the ComponentOne Setup, is queried and accessed through data binding. 

X-Axis ValueLabels are created and used by specifying a text/string DataField for the X vectors of each series.  When a text/string DataField is specified for the X-Axis, the chart automatically enumerates the incoming strings building internal ValueLabels. 

Please note that this sample demonstrates chart data binding. 

The DataChart samples creates a similar application using an unbound chart, manipulating the data in code and applying it to the chart series.
