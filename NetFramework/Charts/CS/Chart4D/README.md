#### Shows a 4 dimensional chart using Chart3D and color.
____
The sample creates a 3D bar or 3D surface chart with added color to produce 4D charts - i.e. charts which show 2 independent values at each point on a bar or surface (elevation and color). 

Multiple data sets and contour data arrays are provided to show the effects.  Zone colors can be modified at runtime through the use of a property grid.
