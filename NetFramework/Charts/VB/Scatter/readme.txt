Scatter
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows a scatter chart and demonstrates mouse tracking with a game.

The sample creates a scatter chart with random data, and tracks the
mouse movement indicating data point selection.  As each point is
selected, the chart plays a game of connect the dots, moving data points
from one series to another.  At the users options, labels are attached
to the selected data points, indicating their order of use.
