PropGrid (Demo2D)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explores all 2D chart types and their properties.

The sample generates all 2D chart types through menu options and allows
customization through a property grid control.  The property grid
control exposes virtually all objects and properties of the 2D chart.

Additionally, the sample allows 2D charts to be loaded or
saved, and chart images to be created or printed.  Mouse tracking
techniques are also demonstrated.
