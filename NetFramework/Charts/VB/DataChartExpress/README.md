#### Shows a 2D Horizontal Bar Chart using C1DataExpress.
____
The sample creates a 2D horizontal bar chart that is loaded from a database.  The database, NWIND.MDB, assumed to be installed by the ComponentOne Setup, is queried and manipulated in code.  The code creates appropriate arrays that are loaded into the chart.  Axis ValueLabels are also created and applied to the chart. 

Please note that this sample does not demonstrate chart databinding, and requires the installation of C1DataExpress.
