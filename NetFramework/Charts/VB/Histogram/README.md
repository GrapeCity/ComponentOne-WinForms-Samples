#### Shows a histogram chart based on data in a 2D scatter chart. 
____
The sample creates a 2D scatter chart with random data, and in a second ChartGroup, develops a histogram based on the distances from each of the data points to a set of crosshairs.
The crosshairs are generated using moveable ValueLabels with markers (arrows) and gridlines.

Three types of distribution charts are available for histogram charts, including Histogram, Frequency graph and a Stepped Frequency graph.
In each case, a Normal (Gaussian) distribution can be shown for comparison to the distribution chart results.

Statistics about the distribution are available for each series array, and are shown for the distances from the crosshairs.

Note also, that the scatter points in the first ChartGroup are automatically labeled using the series DataLabels.
Additionally, Rtf formatting is used in the chart footer.
