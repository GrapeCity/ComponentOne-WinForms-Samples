IncrementalSearch
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add incremental search to the grid.

This sample shows how to incrementally search a column in the grid, if a match is found the grid is positioned to that row.  

It uses the grid's KeyPress event and the grid's indexer to retrieve and compare data for the column.
