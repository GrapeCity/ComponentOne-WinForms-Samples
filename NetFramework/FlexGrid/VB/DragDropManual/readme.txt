DragDropManual
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement manual OleDragDrop between controls and within the grid.

The sample sets DragMode and DropMode to manual and uses the .NET Ole drag drop mechanism to allow dragging tree nodes into the grid.

It also monitors the mouse and uses the DoDragDrop method to start drag-drop operations within the grid allowing the user to drag cells around the grid.
