#### Merge CellStyles assigned to rows, columns, and cells.

Grid styles are hierarchical. You can specify one or more display elements in each style.
Missing elements are inherited from the parent format.
If a row has a style that specifies a red background, and a column has a style that specifies a bold font, cells in that row/column will have a red background and a bold font.
