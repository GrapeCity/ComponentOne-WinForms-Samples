____
#### Shows grouping and sorting behavior when using data-mapped columns.
____
By default, the grid sorts the actual data, not the display value. The sample shows how you can override this behavior and sort by customer name rather than customer ID (for example). 

Grouping is also done based on the actual data, not display value. The sample shows that in the unlikely event you have two or more data values that map to the same display string, the grid will create one group for each value.
