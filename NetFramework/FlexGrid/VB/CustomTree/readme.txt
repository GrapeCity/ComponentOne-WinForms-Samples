CustomTree
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the C1FlexGrid control to build a tree.

The sample does not use Subtotals, it builds the tree using the
Row.IsNode property.

The sample also shows how to use the DrawMode property to create
owner-drawn cells with a gradient background.
