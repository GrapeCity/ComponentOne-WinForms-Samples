____
The sample compares three techniques for loading data into the grid: 

1) AddItem with regular string concatenation and Redraw = true (slowest) 

2) AddItem with StringBuilder concatenation and Redraw = false (faster) 

3) Direct cell assignment (no string conversion) and Redraw = false (fastest)
