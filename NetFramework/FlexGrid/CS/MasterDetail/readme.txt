MasterDetail
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how to create and bind master-detail DataSets in code.

Visual Studio offers a nice design-time environment for creating and
editing data sets, but it's nice to see how you can do the same thing on code.

This sample creates a DataSet, adds two tables and a relation to it, then
binds the master and detail tables to two C1FlexGrid controls.
