DragRow
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Drag rows between grids.

The sample uses manual OLE drag drop (via DragMode and DropMode) to allow you to draw rows from one grid to another.
To drag rows, click a row header on one grid and drag it onto the other.

The base .NET DragDrop support provides several events which the application traps to implement drag source and drop target  behaviors on the grids.
