FindRowRegex
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sample shows how to use the FindRowRegex method.

The FindRowRegEx method was added to the C1FlexGrid in build 526.
It is similar to the traditional FindRow method, but allows for searches based on regular expressions.

The sample also shows how you can implement your own custom version of the FindRowRegEx method,
which can be useful if you are using an older build of the control or if you want to customize the method even further.
