____
#### Provide dynamic data sorting and grouping using the GroupDescriptions property.
____
The sample contains a tab control with two pages.

The first tab page demonstrates how to group data contained in a DataTable using the grid's new GroupDescriptions property.
Buttons along the top of the grid allow you to select the grouping criteria and whether to hide columns being grouped by to present compact views of the data.

The second tab page does the same thing using a SortableBindingList which wraps a simple collection of arbitrary objects.
The SortableBindingList is included in the C1.Win.C1FlexGrid assembly and provides advanced sorting support not available in the standard .NET BindingList class.

The grid columns use the new StarWidth property to fill the grid width according to given proportions (star sizes).
