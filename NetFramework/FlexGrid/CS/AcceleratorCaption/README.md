#### Add accelerator keys to grid captions.

The sample uses the OwnerDraw feature to display accelerators in the grid captions (e.g. &OK). 

It handles the accelerators by creating a button for each accelerator and placing them on the form. When the buttons are activated, they select the appropriate grid column and transfer the focus to the grid.
