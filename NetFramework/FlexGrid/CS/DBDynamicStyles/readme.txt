DBDynamicStyles
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assign styles to grid cells based on their contents.

The sample uses OwnerDraw to select the style dynamically, instead of assigning the styles statically to the rows.
This method works better when the grid is bound to a data source and is much faster when the grid has lots of rows.
