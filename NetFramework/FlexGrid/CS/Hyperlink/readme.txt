Hyperlink
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add hyperlinks to cells in the FlexGrid.

The sample creates a Hyperlink class that provides a descriptive text and a link, and knows how to activate the link.

The grid recognizes the Hyperlink class and adjusts the cursor, styles, and mouse handling to active links when they're clicked.
