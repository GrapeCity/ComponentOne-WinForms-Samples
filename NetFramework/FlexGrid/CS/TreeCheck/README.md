#### Shows how to implement a tree with three-state checkboxes.
____
The sample shows a directory tree where each node has a checkbox. 

Checking or unchecking a node automatically checks/unchecks all child nodes to match, and updates the state of the parent nodes so they are checked/unchecked/indeterminate depending on the state of the child nodes. 

Notice how the code is similar to the one used with a standard TreeView control. Except the standard TreeView does not support three-state checkboxes...
