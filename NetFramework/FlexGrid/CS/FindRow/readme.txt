FindRow

How to find a row in the underlying datasource.

This samples finds a newly added row in the datasource and automatically selects it.
The underlying datasource that the grid is attached to is sorted, so you don't know where the new row will be displayed.
The sample uses the same IBindingList that the grid is using to find the index of the new row.
