SmoothScrolling
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how to implement smooth scrolling on the C1FlexGrid.

When the user clicks the middle mouse button (or wheel), a timer
starts monitoring the mouse offset with respect to the point where
the button was clicked, and scrolling the grid by changing the
ScrollPosition property.
