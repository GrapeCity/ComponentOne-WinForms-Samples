CustomSort
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement your own sorting logic with a custom IComparer object.

The grid has built-in support for sorting with several options (ignore 
case, use the displayed value, etc). If you need more flexibility, you
need to create a class that implements IComparer. The sample shows how.
