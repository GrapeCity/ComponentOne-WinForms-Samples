CustomDragStart
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the BeforeMouseDown event to start dragging rows.

The grid provides an automatic setting for the DragMode property. This behaves like Excel, allowing users to drag the selection by moving the mouse near the edges of the selection.

This sample shows how to customize this behavior so the user can click anywhere in the selection (not just the edges) and start dragging it that way.
