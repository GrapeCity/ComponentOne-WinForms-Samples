#### Summarize and cross-reference data using PivotTables.
____
This sample shows how you can summarize data by applying a cross-tab (aka pivot) transformation to regular data tables.

The PivotTable class takes a regular DataTable and adds 'pivot' columns according to a set of distinct values on a given column.
A value column is then summarized (added or counted) into the appropriate cells in the new pivot columns.

The PivotTable class inherits from DataTable and can be used as a data source for any control. It is not specific to the C1FlexGrid control.

NOTE: This sample requires and the NWind database SqlServer to be installed.
