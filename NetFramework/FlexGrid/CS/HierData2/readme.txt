HierData2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bind to hierarchical data sources (master-detail style).

The sample loads a hierarchical DataSet from the NorthWind database, then binds it to three FlexGrid controls to show Customers, Orders, and Order Details.

When you select a Customer on the first grid, the corresponding Orders are displayed on the second grid.
When you select an Order on the second grid, the order details are displayed on the third grid.
