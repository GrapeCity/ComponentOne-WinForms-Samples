____
#### A grid-based graphical interface for creating Sql statements.
____
The sample has a dialog for building Sql statements. The user selects a connection string, and a TreeView control shows the tables and fields available. 

The user can drag fields from the TreeView to the query grid, set properties on each query field, and reorder fields by dragging. 

The Sql statement is generated and displayed as it is built, and used to populate a grid when the user is done. 

The sample uses the C1FlexGrid as a list editor with support for deleting and reordering rows. This is done with a helper class called BindingArrayList.
