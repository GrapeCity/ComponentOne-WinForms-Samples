#### Host controls in grid cells.
____
The sample uses a simple helper class that associates controls with grid cells. For example, you can insert buttons, textboxes, even other grids into a grid cell. 

When grid rows and columns are moved or resized, the hosted controls are moved and resized as required to follow the host cell.
