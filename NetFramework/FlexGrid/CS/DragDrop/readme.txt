DragDrop
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customize automatic Drag & Drop.

This sample handles a couple of events to customize the drag drop behavior in two ways:
- only copying is allowed, no dragging;
- only numeric selections can be dropped, no text.

The other behavior is standard, including scrolling the grid while dropping the data.
