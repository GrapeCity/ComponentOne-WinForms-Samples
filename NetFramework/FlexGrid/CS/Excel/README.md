The C1FlexGrid control allows you to load and save grids in the xls file format used by Microsoft Excel.
This makes it easy for you to generate files that can be widely distributed and easily manipulated.

The SaveGrid and LoadGrid methods have new settings to handle xls files,
and the new SaveExcel and LoadExcel methods have additional parameters that allow you to save multiple grids as worksheets in a single xls file.
