There are C1FlexGridGroupPanel and C1FlexGrid controls on the form and flexGrid is assigned to groupPanel.FlexGrid property. 

Drag some header of FlexGrid column and drop it over GroupPanel. The results of the groping will appear in FlexGrid. If you want to limit amount of groups you can setup MaxGroup property of GroupPanel. Also, groups can be in collapsed state after grouping by setting AutoExpandGroups to false.
