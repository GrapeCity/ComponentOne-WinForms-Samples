GridChart
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Attach a FlexGrid to a C1Chart control.

The sample uses C1Chart to display the data on the grid. As the user changes the grid data, the chart reflects the changes.
If the user clicks a point on the chart, the corresponding data is selected on the grid.
