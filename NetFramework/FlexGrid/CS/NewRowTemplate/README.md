#### Place a new row template above the grid.

The C1FlexGrid AllowAddNew property adds a new row template at the bottom of the grid, like MS Access, the .NET DataGrid and most other grid controls. 

This sample shows how you can create a new row template in the top row instead, like the "To-do" list in Visual Studio. 

Press F3 to move the cursor to the new row, and Enter to commit the new row to the grid.
