#### Shows how to merge menus using methods provided by C1Command
____
Contains two forms, both with C1MainMenu's on them. One form is created at application startup, and is the main form of the app. It has a command to create the other form. When that form is created, its main menu is merged programmatically into the main menu of the first form, in the same way as MDI child menus are merged in Windows.
