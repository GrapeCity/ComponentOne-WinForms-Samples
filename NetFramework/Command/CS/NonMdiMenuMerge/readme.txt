NonMdiMenuMerge
----------------------------------------
Shows how to merge menus using methods provided by C1Command

Contains two forms, both with C1MainMenu's on them. One form is
created at application startup, and is the main form of the app. It
has a command to create the other form. When that form is created, its
main menu is merged programmatically into the main menu of the first
form, in the same way as MDI child menus are merged in Windows.
