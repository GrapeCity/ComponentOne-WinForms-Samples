ProgramOutBar
----------------------------------------
Shows how to add toolbars to a C1OutBar in code

The sample starts with a form containing a C1OutBar with two empty
pages (created at design time). The form also contains an empty
command holder. In the form load handler, a bunch of commands is
crated on the command holder. Two toolbars are also created and filled
with links to the commands. The toolbars are placed on the outbar
pages.
