#### Shows how to add toolbars to a C1OutBar in code
____
The sample starts with a form containing a C1OutBar with two empty pages (created at design time).
The form also contains an empty command holder.
In the form load handler, a bunch of commands is crated on the command holder.
Two toolbars are also created and filled with links to the commands. The toolbars are placed on the outbar pages.
