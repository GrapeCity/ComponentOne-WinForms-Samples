Overview
----------------------------------------

This sample is a very basic text editor built around the standard rich
text box control, and using the C1Command suite to provide user
interface. All sample code is in the file SimpleTextEditor.vb. It
contains definition of the class SimpleTextEditor, which inherits from
Form and has the following main components:

o  RichTextBox1            - the rich text box control used to view
                             and edit text in the editor.

o  C1CommandHolder1        - C1CommandHolder component, containers
                             for all commands.

o  C1MainMenu1             - C1MainMenu control which is the main menu
                             of the text editor.

o  C1CommandDock1          - C1CommandDock (itself docked to the top
                             of the form just below the main menu)
                             which contains editor toolbars.

o  tbFile                  - C1ToolBar with file-related commands
                             (file open, save, etc.).

o  tbEdit                  - C1ToolBar with edit-related commands
                             (cut/copy/paste).

o  tbFormat                - C1ToolBar with format-related commands
                             (fonts etc.).

o  A number of miscellaneous controls and components, such as file
   dialogs, sub-menus, etc.

Most of the operations available in the editor are provided by the
rich text box itself. These include file open and save, cut, copy and
paste operations, undo and redo, formatting and so on. Each such
operation is invoked by the Click event handler of the corresponding
C1Command object. C1Command objects themselves are included in the
menus and toolbars by means of C1CommandLink links which are added to
those menus and toolbars, and link to their C1Command objects.

Please see the sample code for details. Notes on some specific
features illustrated by the sample are provided below.


Keeping Commands' State Updated
----------------------------------------

The state of all commands (whether they are enabled or disabled,
checked or unchecked and so on) is kept constantly updated by
C1CommandHolder which has a feature (controlled by the
StateUpdateOnIdle boolean property, true by default) to fire
CommandStateQuery events for all commands when the system is idle. So
the only thing needed to make sure a particular command's state is
correct at all times is to provide a CommandStateQuery event handler
for it. For example, here is such an event handler for the copy
command (enabled when the current selection is not empty):

Private Sub cmdCopy_CommandStateQuery(ByVal sender As Object, _
        ByVal e As C1.Win.Command.CommandStateQueryEventArgs) _
        Handles cmdCopy.CommandStateQuery
    e.Enabled = Me.RichTextBox1.SelectionType <> RichTextBoxSelectionTypes.Empty
End Sub


Providing a Context Menu
----------------------------------------

C1CommandHolder implements the IExtenderProvider interface, providing
a C1ContextMenu property to all controls on the form. Thus, any
control will have a property with a name like "C1ContextMenu on
C1CommandHolder1", of the type C1ContextMenu. All C1ContextMenu
components defined on a form are available as context menus (and can
also be used as submenus anywhere a C1CommandMenu can be used). In
this sample, menuEdit (which is also a submenu of the main form's
menu) is of type C1ContextMenu and thus can be used also as a context
menu. It is the context menu of the sample's rich text box.


Using C1Command.Pressed as Checkbox
----------------------------------------

You can use the C1Command.Pressed property as another alternative for
the Checked property, indicating boolean items which are currently on.
Pressed commands are indicated by a different background color and a
border. (Checked commands are indicated by another background color;
in menus, checked commands' images are replaced by the checkmark,
whereas pressed commands' images are always drawn.)

In this sample, this is demonstrated by the three cmdCharOffset*
(Normal, Sub and Super) commands. Each of these commands has an on/off
state (indicating the current char offset of the rich text box). When
one of these commands is clicked, the current char offset of the text
box is set accordingly. Also each command has a CommandStateQuery
event handler, which updates the command's Pressed property value
based on the current char offset of the rich text control. Because
CommandStateQuery events are fired automatically, the commands' state
is always up to date.


Saving/Restoring the Toolbar Layout
----------------------------------------

With C1Command, you can easily provide your users with the possibility
to customize their toolbars: add or remove buttons, adjust
docking/floating state and positions, and to restore all that on
subsequent program runs. For this to work, you should perform the
following: In the form editor's tray, click on the C1CommandHolder
component, go to its Dynamic properties, expand it and add the Layout
property to the list of dynamic properties. This will make Layout
saved in the application's .config file instead of in the form's code.

Such use is demonstrated in this example, see C1CommandHolder1.Layout
property.

Note 1: You can use your own scheme for saving and restoring the
toolbars layout. For finer control, save and set the value of the
Layout property in your code instead.

Note 2: When you run your program from the Visual Studio's designer,
Visual Studio creates an app.config file in the project directory, and
then on each run replaces the actual application's .config file
(located in the bin directory) with that app.config file's contents.
As a result, if in the Visual Studio you run your project, change the
toolbars layout, close it and then run it again, you won't see the
last layout restored. This is not a bug, everything works fine when
run not from the Visual Studio.
