SimpleMenusInCode
----------------------------------------
Shows how to created menus and toolbars in code.

This sample project shows how to created menus and toolbars, customize
their look and attach event handlers to them completely in code. The
sample app is a form with a rich text editor control. The form load
event handler creates C1Command commands to load a text file, create
a new form, or exit the application. It also creates a main menu and a
toolbar that allow the user to invoke those commands.
