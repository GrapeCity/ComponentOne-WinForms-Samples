    <h2>Josh Hamilton Story</h2>

    <p>Over the last five weeks of the season, Josh Hamilton missed 25 of the Texas Rangers' final 30 games because of two fractured ribs. His absence during the stretch run barely mattered to voters from the Baseball Writers' Association of America, who followed a powerful precedent set last year by Joe Mauer of Minnesota, Hamilton's predecessor as the American League's most valuable player.</p>
    <p>Josh Hamilton missed 25 of the Texas Rangers' final 30 games because of two fractured ribs.</p>
    <p>The Rangers would not have coasted to their first division title since 1999 without Hamilton, whose production before he got hurt was nothing short of transcendent. Hamilton collected 22 of 28 first-place votes in balloting announced Tuesday, beating Miguel Cabrera of Detroit, who received five, by 96 points. Robinson Cano of the Yankees finished third, and Toronto's Jose Bautista, who earned the other first-place vote, finished fourth.</p>
    <p>For Hamilton, the award represents another milepost in his five-year transformation from drug addict to sober baseball star. He won the A.L. batting title with a .359 average, while also leading the league in slugging percentage (.633), on-base percentage plus slugging (1.044) and hitting with runners in scoring position (.369).</p>
    <p>"When you look at what he did, and the impact he had on the race, I would argue that what he did in three months made it irrelevant that he played only five games in the last five weeks," said Mark Feinsand of The Daily News, who voted for Hamilton.</p>
    <p>When May ended, Texas trailed Oakland by one game in the A.L. West. On June 1, Hamilton began a three-month spree that lifted the Rangers to a nine-game division lead heading into Sept. 4, when he slammed into an outfield wall in Minnesota. During that span, Hamilton led the majors with a .410 average, 70 runs batted in, a .461 O.B.P., a .717 slugging percentage, 51 extra-base hits and 226 total bases.</p>
    <p>"He hit over .400 for an 80-something-game stretch, and during the time of the season when the Rangers kind of really asserted themselves in their division race," said Marc Topkin of The St. Petersburg Times, who voted for Hamilton. "It wasn't coincidental that that's when they took off. To me, that was the difference.</p>
    <p>"Cano had a great year. If there was a most outstanding player category, Cabrera would have been a guy. But I don't think in this situation that either one of them was more valuable than Hamilton."</p>
