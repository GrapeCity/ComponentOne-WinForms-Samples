Metafile
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Renders several metafiles into one PDF document.

The sample loads metafile images from disk and then renders each image
on a page. It then renders the same metafile again at a smaller size
to show how the metafile images can be scaled and remain resolution-
independent.

The ability to render Metafile images without converting them to bitmaps
is one of the main features of C1Pdf.
