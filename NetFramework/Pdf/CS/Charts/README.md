____
#### Creates a PDF document containing charts created with the C1Chart control.
____
The sample creates metafiles for several 2 and 3D charts, then renders the metafiles into a PDF document using the DrawImage method. 

The charts are rendered as a sequence of graphics commands (they are not translated into bitmaps). As a result, the charts are rendered in a high-quality, resolution-independent way. 

This sample uses C1Chart and C1Chart3D.
