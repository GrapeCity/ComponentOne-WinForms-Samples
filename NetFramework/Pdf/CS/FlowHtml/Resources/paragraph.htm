This is a pre-formatted paragraph. It has one long line that should not wrap and
  some
    breaks
      and
        white space
          that
            should
              be
                preserved.
                  Done.



</PRE>Now we're back to normal. Add a horizontal ruler (&lt;HR&gt;) 
<HR>
and be done. </BODY></HTML>
