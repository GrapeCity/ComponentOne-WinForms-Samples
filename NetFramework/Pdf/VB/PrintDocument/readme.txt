PrintDocument
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how to convert a .NET PrintDocument into a Pdf file.

The sample creates a System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument, renders it into a PrintPreviewController, then transfers the images from the preview controller into a pdf document.

This method can be used to leverage existing code that creates documents based on the PrintDocument class to create pdf files easily.
