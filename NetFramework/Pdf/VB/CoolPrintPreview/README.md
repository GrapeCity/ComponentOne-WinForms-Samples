#### Implements an enhanced PrintPreviewDialog with PDF support.
____
The standard PrintPreviewDialog class is handy and easy to use, but it is limited and looks outdated (it hasn't changed since .NET 1.0). 

This sample implements a drop-in replacement class called CoolPrintPreviewDialog with the following enhancements: 

1) PDF support. 

2) Show preview pages as the document is generated (the default class renders the entire document before the preview appears). 

3) Show the current page number and the total number of pages (the default class only shows the current page number).  4) Provide printer and page setup buttons. 

5) Support printing page ranges (the default class only prints the entire document). 

6) Use a ToolStrip (the default class uses an outdated-looking ToolBar). 

If you have an application that uses the PrintPreviewDialog class, you can replace it with the CoolPrintPreviewDialog and instantly get all these features for free!
