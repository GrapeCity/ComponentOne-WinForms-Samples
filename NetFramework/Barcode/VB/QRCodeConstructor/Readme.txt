QRCodeConstructor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A utility to generate QuickRead (QR) codes.

The utility allows you to enter formatted information, then converts it into a QR code
that you can save or print.

The utility uses a C1Ribbon control to provide navigation, C1Input and C1DockingTab 
controls to provide the data entry, and the C1BarCode control to generate the actual 
bar codes. The sample UI also uses the C1SuperErrorProvider and C1WindoswsTaskDialog.

The utility uses the CoolPrintPreviewControl, included in source format, to provide
a print preview of the bar code.
