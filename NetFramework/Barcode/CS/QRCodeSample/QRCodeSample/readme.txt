QCodeSample
------------------------------------------------------------------
Demonstrates how to use the C1QRCode control.

The C1QRCode control creates QR (Quick Response) 2D bar codes that
are extremely compact compared to 1D alternatives, and can be 
scanned using most smart phones and utilities that are freely 
available.

The C1QRCode control was added to the C1BarCode assembly in version 
4.0.20112.45.

Using the C1QRCode control is extremely easy. Simply set the control's
Text property and the QR code will be generated automatically. If you
want to use the QR image in a document or report, you can retrieve 
it using the Image property or the GetImage method.
