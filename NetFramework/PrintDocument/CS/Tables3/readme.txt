Tables3
----------------------------------------
Shows multiple inheritance of styles in C1PrintDocument tables.

The sample demonstrates multiple inheritance of styles in tables. A
table with some test data is inserted into the document. Some style
attributes are redefined for the styles of a row, a column, and a cell
group. Cells at the intersections of the groups inherit styles for
all, combining them.
