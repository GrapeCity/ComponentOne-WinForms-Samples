#### Shows how to find the render object under the mouse in preview.
____
The sample shows how to connect the coordinates in the preview pane with the objects in the C1PrintDocument being previewed. Methods are provided that find the RenderObject currently under the mouse, query the properties of the object, highlight it in the preview, and manipulate it: change the object's background color, text, or other properties. The changes are immediately reflected in the document. 

Note that for highlighting to work, build 2.0.20062.40855 or later of the C1Preview is required.
