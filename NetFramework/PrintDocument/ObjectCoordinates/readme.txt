ObjectCoordinates
----------------------------------------
Shows how to find the render object under the mouse in preview.

The sample shows how to connect the coordinates in the preview pane with 
the objects in the C1PrintDocument being previewed. Methods are provided 
that find the RenderObject currently under the mouse, query the 
properties of the object, highlight it in the preview, and manipulate 
it: change the object's background color, text, or other properties. The 
changes are immediately reflected in the document.
