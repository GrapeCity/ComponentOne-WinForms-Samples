____
#### This sample shows a short-cut approach to printing your C1Schedule exactly 'as-is' on your screen.
____
This sample is intended to be a starting point for creating WYSIWYG printing for C1Schedule.
It's not as complete as the built-in printing, but it's completely open to customize how you need.
Detailed sample description is posted in the blog article: http://our.componentone.com/2011/01/24/custom-wysiwyg-printing-of-c1schedule/

The sample uses C1Schedule.ScrollSize, ScrollableRectangle and ScrollPosition properties to implement pagination of large content.
