UnBound
=======
This sample demonstrates using C1Schedule in unbound mode.

When loaded the application loads data from a  XML file. 
On exit the application saves data to the same file.
If there is no previously saved data, the application creates new XML file 
in the working folder.

End-users can import and export data at any time by using 
Import/Export items from the C1Schedule control's context menu
