DataBinding
----------------------------------------
Demonstrates the basics of data binding and scripting in C1PrintDocument

The sample demonstrates binding to a simple list (including binding to 
an empty list), master-detail with vertical master binding and horizontal
detail, binding to a MS Access database, the use of grouping, 
aggregate functions, and binding of table row/column groups. This sample 
requires a 2009 v3 version (C1Report.3.6.20093.53207 or later).
