#### Use a C1FlexGrid control as a data source for your reports.
____
The sample builds a report based on a C1FlexGrid control. This is done in two steps: 

First, the sample creates a report definition based on the names and widths of the grid columns. 

Then is creates a DataSource object that retrieves data from the grid and feeds it to the report component. 

Note that in this sample, the grid is bound to a DataTable, which could be used directly as a data source. But the approach used here is general and would work on unbound grids as well.
