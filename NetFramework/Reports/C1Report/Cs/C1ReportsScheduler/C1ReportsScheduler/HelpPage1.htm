  <h3>
    Overview
  </h3>
  <p>
    C1ReportsScheduler is designed to run ComponentOne Reports tasks in the background
    on schedules. The following report task types are supported:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>XML report definition loaded into a C1Report component;</li>
    <li>XML report definition imported into a C1PrintDocument component;</li>
    <li>Data bound C1PrintDocument loaded from a C1D/C1DX file;</li>
    <li>Executable user program generating and exporting or printing a report.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For each task, multiple actions can be specified. E.g. a report can be exported
    to PDF and Excel files, and printed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each task also has an associated schedule that specifies when the task needs to
    be executed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The C1ReportsScheduler consists of two related interacting parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>C1ReportsScheduler Frontend (C1ReportsScheduler.exe; this application).</li>
    <li>C1ReportsScheduler Windows service (C1ReportsSchedulerService.exe).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In the recommended mode of operation, the service (C1ReportsSchedulerService.exe)
    runs in the background, executing specified tasks according to their schedules.
    The frontend (C1ReportsScheduler.exe) can be used to view or edit the task list,
    start or stop schedules, and control the service. While the frontend is used to
    install and setup the service, it is not needed for the service to run, so normally
    it would be started to adjust the list of scheduled tasks as needed, and exited.
    (If the service is installed on a machine, the frontend connects to it automatically
    when started.)
  </p>
  <p>
    While not recommended, standalone mode of operation is also possible. In this mode,
    the frontend is also used to actually run the scheduled tasks. In that case, of
    course, terminating the frontend app will also stop all schedules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that all service specific operations (installation, setup, and un-installation)
    can be performed from the frontend application.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Installation and Setup
  </h3>
  <p>
    When the C1ReportsScheduler.exe is run for the first time, a dialog pops up asking
    whether you would like to install the C1ReportsScheduler service. Click "Yes" to
    install the service (recommended). Then a form is shown allowing to set up the service
    parameters such as the WCF address used by the frontend to communicate with the
    service, the path of the service configuration file (.c1rsconf), service startup
    type (manual or automatic), and log options.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adjust the parameters if necessary (defaults should normally work), and click "OK"
    to install the service. The progress window should appear, and when it closes the
    frontend should be running in client mode. This is indicated by the words "client
    mode" in the form's caption, and "[&nbsp;Client&nbsp;]" in the status line (which
    should also contain an icon showing a gear with a green checkmark).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you click "No" when asked whether to install the service, the frontend will start
    in standalone mode, as indicated in the form's caption and status line. You can
    still add tasks, specify their actions and schedules and start them. The only difference
    is that in standalone mode you will need to keep the frontend running for the tasks
    to run on schedules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that when in standalone mode, at any time you can install the service and transfer
    your task list to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    To uninstall the service, start the frontend, and select "Uninstall Service..."
    from the "Service" menu.
  </p>
  <h3>
    User Interface
  </h3>
  <p>
    The form caption is used to show the current mode (client or standalone).
  </p>
  <p>
    The status bar has two areas:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>On the far right of the status bar, a small icon and a short text shows the current
      mode:
      <ul>
        <li>Client.</li>
        <li>Standalone.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the current task or action has errors, the main status area shows the error
      description (e.g. the report definition file is not found).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The main C1ReportsScheduler window is divided into three areas:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The upper part of the main window shows the task list. Each task defines a report
      or document scheduled for generation.</li>
    <li>The lower left part of the main window shows the list of actions defined for the
      current task.</li>
    <li>The lower right part of the main window shows the schedule for the current task.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>
    Task List</h4>
  <p>
    Task list is represented by a grid with the following columns:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>File Name.
      <ul>
        <li>C1Report/Imported C1Report type of tasks, this is the name of the report definition
          file.</li>
        <li>For C1PrintDocument type of tasks, this is the name of C1D/C1DX file containing
          the document.</li>
        <li>For External executable type of tasks, this is the name of the executable file
          to run.</li>
      </ul>
      You may click the button to the right of the file name textbox to select the file.
    </li>
    <li>Report Name.<br />
      This column is used only for C1Report/Imported C1Report tasks, it specifies the
      name of the report. It is a combobox, when a report definition file is selected
      in the first column, the combo dropdown is automatically filled with available reports'
      names. </li>
    <li>Report Type.<br />
      This column specifies the type of the current task. The following report task types
      are supported:
      <ul>
        <li>C1Report.<br />
          For tasks of this type, an instance of C1Report component is used to load the report
          definition and generate the report. </li>
        <li>Imported C1Report.<br />
          For tasks of this type, an instance of C1PrintDocument component is used to import
          the report definition and generate the report.</li>
        <li>C1PrintDocument.<br />
          For tasks of this type, an instance of C1PrintDocument is used to load and generate
          the document.</li>
        <li>External executable.<br />
          Tasks of this type are represented by external programs. The intention is to run
          applications that rely on code when generating reports. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Task state (this column does not have a caption).<br />
      This shows a small image representing the current state of the task:
      <ul>
        <li>A gray ball represents an unchecked task.</li>
        <li>A green ball represents a successfully checked task that is currently not running.</li>
        <li>A yellow ball represents a successfully checked task that is currently running.</li>
        <li>A yellow triangle with an exclamation mark represents a task that has errors.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Status.<br />
      This column shows the current state of the task:
      <ul>
        <li>Ready.<br />
          Task is ready but is not scheduled. This is the only status allowing to edit the
          task.</li>
        <li>Scheduled.<br />
          Task is scheduled for execution. Changes are not allowed to a task with this status.</li>
        <li>Busy.<br />
          A scheduled task that is currently running. Changes are not allowed to a task with
          this status.</li>
        <li>Paused.<br />
          Task is scheduled for execution but the schedule is paused. Changes are not allowed
          to a task with this status.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To manipulate task list, use the Task menu or the toolbar on the left of the task
    grid.</p>
  <h4>
    Action List</h4>
  <p>
    This is the list of actions associated with the current (in the Task List) task.
    Action list is represented by a grid with the following columns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Action.<br />
      This is the type of action. The following action types are supported:
      <ul>
        <li>Export.<br />
          Exports the report or document represented by the current task to one of the supported
          external formats.<br />
          This action type is not allowed for External executable type of tasks. </li>
        <li>Print.<br />
          Prints the report or document represented by the current task.<br />
          This action type is not allowed for External executable type of tasks. </li>
        <li>Run.<br />
          Runs the executable.<br />
          This action type is only allowed for External executable type of tasks.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Export Format.<br />
      For export actions, this column specifies the export format. Note that different
      sets of export formats are available for tasks using C1Report and C1PrintDocument
      components (this is similar to the way export of those components is handled by
      the preview controls). </li>
    <li>Output File/Printer Name.<br />
      Specifies either the name of the exported file, or the name of the printer used.<br />
      Click the button to the right of this textbox to select the file or printer name
      (depending on the action type). </li>
    <li>The last column (without a title) is used to show a small image representing the
      current status of the action:
      <ul>
        <li>A gray ball represents an unchecked action that is currently not running.</li>
        <li>A green ball represents a successfully checked action that is currently not running.</li>
        <li>A yellow ball represents a successfully checked action that is currently running.</li>
        <li>A yellow triangle with an exclamation mark represents an action that has errors.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To manipulate action list, use the Action menu or the toolbar on the left of the
    action grid.</p>
  <h4>
    Schedule</h4>
  <p>
    This panel shows the schedule associated with the current task.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the upper left part of the panel there are 4 radiobuttons specifying how often
    the task will run. Note that the first option (One time) allows the task to repeat
    every specified number of seconds, minutes or hours. Other options are self-explanatory,
    and as each option is selected, the schedule panel shows different sets of controls.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the bottom part of the panel, there are two buttons allowing to start, stop,
    pause or resume the current task. The buttons change depending on the current status
    of the current task.
  </p>
  <p>
    To the right of the buttons, the time is shown when the task will run next time.
  </p>
  <p>
    To manipulate schedule, use the Schedule menu.</p>
