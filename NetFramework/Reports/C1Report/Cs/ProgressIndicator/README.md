This sample renders a long report with an option of progress indicators. A progress indicator form with a Cancel button or a simple StatusBar. 

The progress indicator form is interesting because it allows the user to cancel the report. The progress indicator form is generic. The constructor takes a C1Report object as a parameter and automatically wires up the necessary events.
