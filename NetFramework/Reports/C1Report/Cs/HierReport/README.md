#### Create reports based on hierarchical data.
____
The sample loads a DataSet from an XML file that contains several tables, connected by relations. 

The sample then uses a ConnectDataSet method to connect the main report and each subreport to the corresponding tables in the DataSet. 

The ConnectDataSet method uses the relations to set the Text property on the subreport fields so that the data on each subreport reflects the current master record on the parent report.
