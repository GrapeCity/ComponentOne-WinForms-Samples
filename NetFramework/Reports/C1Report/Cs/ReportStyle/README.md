This sample implements at runtime the style selection step of the "new report" wizard of the Report Designer application. The end user can choose a report definition file, and a report from it. The selected report is shown in the preview. The user then can open a dialog presenting the list of predefined visual styles and pick a style to apply to the currently loaded report.
