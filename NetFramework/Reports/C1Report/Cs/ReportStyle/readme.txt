ReportStyle
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Select and apply a style to a report like in ReportDesigner's Wizard.

This sample implements at runtime the style selection step of the "new 
report" wizard of the Report Designer application. The end user can 
choose a report definition file, and a report from it. The selected 
report is shown in the preview. The user then can open a dialog 
presenting the list of predefined visual styles and pick a style to 
apply to the currently loaded report.
