#### Create custom data source objects for use with C1Report.
____
C1Report allows you to use many types of data sources. Any object that implements the IBindingList and ITypedList can be used directly (e.g. DataView objects). 

Alternatively, you can implement the IC1ReportRecordset interface and use your objects as data sources. The sample illustrates this by creating a data source object with information from a disk directory.
