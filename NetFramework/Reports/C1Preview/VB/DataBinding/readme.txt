DataBinding
----------------------------------------
Demonstrates the basics of data binding and scripting in C1PrintDocument

The sample demonstrates binding to a simple list (including binding to 
an empty list), binding to a MS Access database, the use of grouping, 
aggregate functions, and binding of table row/column groups. This sample 
requires a 2006 T3 version (C1Preview.2 2.0.20063.41002 or later).
