PageLayout2
----------------------------------------
Shows how to use the LayoutChangeBefore property of RenderObject.

The sample creates a document with an object that forces a page break,
and a different page layout that is "nested" within the current
layout, so that the current layout is automatically restored when the
nested object is over.
