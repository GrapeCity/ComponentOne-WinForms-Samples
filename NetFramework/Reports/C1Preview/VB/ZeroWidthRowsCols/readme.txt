ZeroWidthRowsCols
----------------------------------------
Demonstrates the treatment of table columns with zero width

The sample shows that columns with zero width/rows with zero height are 
not rendered at all (as if their Visible property were set to false). 
Requires a 2006 T3 (or later) build of C1Preview.
