#### Demonstrates the use of C1SSRSDocumentSource and C1RibbonPreview components
____
This sample shows how C1SSRSDocumentSource component can be used with C1RibbonPreview to browse the reports tree available on a SSRS server, and preview individual reports. 

The code connects to an example SSRS server provided by ComponentOne. Adjust the C1SSRSDocumentSource's properties to connect to a different report server (such as one provided by your company for example).
