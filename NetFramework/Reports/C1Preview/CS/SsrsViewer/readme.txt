Demonstrates the use of C1SSRSDocumentSource component

This sample shows how C1SSRSDocumentSource component can be used by
C1PrintPreviewControl to browse the reports tree available on a SSRS
server, and preview individual reports.

The code connects to an example SSRS server provided by ComponentOne.
Adjust the C1SSRSDocumentSource's properties to connect to a different
report server (such as one provided by your company for example).
