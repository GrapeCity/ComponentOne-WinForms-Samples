#### This sample provides classes allowing you to print a C1FlexGrid using C1PrintDocument. 
____
This sample replaces the C1FlexGridPrintable sample. 

C1FlexGridPrinter is a library providing classes that allow rendering a C1FlexGrid into a C1PrintDocument so that it can be printed, previewed, or exported to any of the formats supported by C1PrintDocument. This set of classes replaces the older C1FlexGridPrintable class. 

The C1FlexGridPrinter sample provides more features than the old C1FlexGridPrintable sample it replaces; highlights of the sample include: 

- More accurate rendering of FlexGrid display styles - Printing owner-drawn cells (see the BarChart sample) - Printing child grids with hierarchical data (see the DataTree sample) - Support for C1FlexGrid-style print customization (see the CustomPrint sample) - Ability to print controls hosted in grid cells (see the HostControls sample) - Hyperlinks in the resulting C1PrintDocument (see the Hyperlink sample) - Easy customization of the printout via the rich C1PrintDocument object model 

This project references the following ComponentOne assemblies (the assembly versions indicated in parentheses are confirmed to work well with the samples): 

- C1.Win.C1FlexGrid.2 (2.6.20102.554 or later) - C1.C1Report.2       (2.6.20102.54119 or later) - C1.Win.C1Report.2   (2.0.20102.54119 or later)
