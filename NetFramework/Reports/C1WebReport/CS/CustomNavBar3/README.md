#### Use custom images in the C1WebReport Navigation Bar.
____
In addition to changing the navigation bar style, you can customize its images. There are three image collections that define the appearance of the buttons in their normal state, mouse over state, and disabled state. The image collections are exposed through properties: Images, MouseOverImages, and DisabledImages. 

You can also customize the content of the toltips associated with each element in the navigation bar. This is done using the ToolTips property.
