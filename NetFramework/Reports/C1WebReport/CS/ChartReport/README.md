____
#### Create reports with embedded charts, gradients, and bar code fields.
____
There is no code behind the report. The charts, gradients, and bar code were created with the Report Designer application and saved into a regular report definition file (nwindchrt.xml). 

This sample uses the CustomFields sample assembly. To avoid conflicts between versions of C1Report and C1Chart used by CustomFields, this sample includes its own copy of that sample rather than referencing a pre-build assembly.
