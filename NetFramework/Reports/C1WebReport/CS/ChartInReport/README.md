#### Shows a C1WebChart in a C1WebReport.
____
The sample shows how you can add a chart created with C1WebChart to C1WebReport. This is done using the StartSection event to read the chart image off the C1WebChart control and assign it to the Picture property of a report field. 

The C1WebReport ImageRenderMethod is set to HttpHandler, so there are no temporary files. 

The C1WebReport EnableCallbacks is set to true, so Ajax is enabled and paging is smooth.
