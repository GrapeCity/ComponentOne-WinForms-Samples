#### Create reports that use custom paper sizes.
____
Custom paper sizes are useful not only when creating actual printed reports on custom paper, but also when you want to export to PDF, HTML, and RTF formats and would like control over the size of the pages. 

You can do this by assigning a custom paper size directly to the PrintDocument object (returned by C1Report Document property), or by setting the Layout.CustomWidth and Layout.CustomHeight properties.
