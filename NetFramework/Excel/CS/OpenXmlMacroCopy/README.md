#### Copy template Excel workbook into a new workbook with VBA macro.
____
The sample loads the template xls file with VBA macro in a folder, clones the workbook, adds comment about copy, renames it with the file name.
It then saves the new workbook into a file and opens that. It works only for XLSM files (Open XML format with VBA macro).
