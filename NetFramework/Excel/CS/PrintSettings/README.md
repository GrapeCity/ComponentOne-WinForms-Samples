#### Shows how to get and set print settings saved with a sheet.
____
The sample has a Load button that opens an existing xls file and shows the print settings for the first sheet.

You can modify the print settings, then click the Save button to save a new file (in the c:\temp folder).
The new file is then displayed in Excel so you can check the new print settings.
