CellBorders
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the XLStyle class to render custom borders on a sheet.

The sample allows you to create borders around arbitrary ranges. You can control border width, style, color, etc.

When you are done creating the borders, click the last button on the toolbar to export the grid to Excel, including the custom borders.
