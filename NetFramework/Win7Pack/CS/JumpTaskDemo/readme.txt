C1JumpTask Demo
---------------------
This sample adds the Task category to a custom Jump List.

In this sample we add dynamic Tasks to a Jump List. Typically, tasks are IShellLink items with command-line
arguments that indicate particular functionality that can be triggered by an application. The C1JumpTask
class encapsulates the shell interface. It's pretty easy to manipulate tasks using the C1TaskbarButton
component.
