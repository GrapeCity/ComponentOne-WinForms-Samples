#### Shows how to apply conditional formatting to an FlexPivotGrid control using the C1FlexGrid's OwnerDraw feature.
____
The FlexPivotGrid derives from the C1FlexGrid control, so you can use the standard OwnerDraw mechanism to apply styles to cells based on their contents (or to draw the entire cell if you prefer).

This sample shows a grid where values greater than 100 appear with a light green background.
