The sample represents a form with a C1Ribbon on the top. The ribbon contains a gallery of views available.
When a user selects a view, the view is shown on the right in form of a C1FlexPivotGrid or a C1FlexPivotChart.
On the left, in a dashboard layout (C1DashboardLayout) a list of available for filtering fields is shown.
User can select check/uncheck the fields in the list.
The panels with the C1FlexPivotSlicer control inside are shown in on the left.

* setup a C1FlexPivotSlicer control;
* change C1FlexPivotSlicer control behavior;
* dynamically add/remove and setup C1DashboardLayout panels.
