Shows how to add data incrementally using C1 DataEngine

This sample shows how to add data to already existing
data on disk. This feature of C1 DataEngine allows to
avoid repeating lengthy data import every time.
Just add new data rows to already existing ones.

Repeating data import is not needed even if you close
and restart application. C1 DataEngine shows the
latest results without repeating data import and
without repeating lengthy calculations.
