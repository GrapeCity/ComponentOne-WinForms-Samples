This sample shows how to add data to already existing data on disk. This feature of C1 DataEngine allows to avoid repeating lengthy data import every time.

Repeating data import is not needed even if you close and restart application.
C1 DataEngine shows the latest results without repeating data import and without repeating lengthy calculations.
