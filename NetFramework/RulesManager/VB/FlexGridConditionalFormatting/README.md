This sample demonstrates basic functionality of the C1RulesManager control.
The C1RulesManager provides a conditional formatting for a control which supports IFormattableView interface.
Such support is built-in for C1FlexGrid control.
The rules manager control contains a collection of rules which can be setup in variety of parameters - with predefined or custom expression, with different styling options.
Also each rule can be applied to the whole data or specific range of it.
Each UI element of control (e.g. header, add or remove rule buttons, rule expression editor, etc.) can be hidden separately if such UI element would not be used in final application.
The C1RulesManager supports saving and subsequent loading of rules to/from xml file.
