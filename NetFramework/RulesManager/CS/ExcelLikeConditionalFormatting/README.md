The C1RulesManager control provides API for setting up rule expression, style and to which range of data such rule should be applied. Using of API allows to develop application which even not show rules manager control in the application, but apply conditional formatting. As an example of such application can be excel-like app with conditional formatting which use for setup of rules some forms with predefined expression and styles or even some menu items which apply some gradient rule (data bars, color scales, icon sets) to the currently selected cells of grid.
