Shows using FlexChart as a custom DataFilter

The sample demonstrates using FlexChart for creating custom DataFilters in WinForms. The sample showcases multiple filtering modes using FlexChart, namely:
1. Normal Select: Click on any data point on the chart to show its corresponding details in the grid.
2. Range Select: Hold and drag the mouse over a chart region to select a range of values. The chart filters out records and displays the details for the selected range of items in the grid.
3. RangeSlider: There is also an option to use a RangeSlider tool along with Numeric/DateTime editors to zoom-in/zoom out from the chart and filter the grid.

Along with this, the sample also showcases a FlexChartDateTimeFilter which allows grouping DateTime data on the chart by Weeks, Months, Quarters, and Years.
