#### This sample demonstrates how to use C1DataFilter control to filter the C1TrueDBGrid control. 
____
This sample shows how to modify automatically generated filters.
The DataFilter control supports different kinds of filters for different types of data.
By default, filters are automatically generated depending on the type of the fields present in the DataSource.

When end-user changes filter conditions, DataFilter applies conditions to the underlying data source.
In this sample **FlexGrid.DataSource** property and **DataFilter.DataSource** property are both set to the same data collection.
That allows to filter FlexGrid content based on multiple conditions selected in the C1DataFilter.
