* The Label property sets a text on the left side of the summary, like "{label} {aggregate value}".
* The PropertyName property sets the name of the property for which the aggregate function is applied.
* The CustomFormat is used for formatting aggregation result, like "C0" for the "Max Price" aggregate.
