#### This sample demonstrates how to use C1DataFilter control to filter the C1FlexGrid control.
____
This sample demonstrates basic functionality of the C1DataFilter control.
The DataFilter control supports different kinds of filters for different types of data.
By default, filters are automatically generated depending on the type of the fields present in the DataSource.
When end-user changes filter conditions, DataFilter applies conditions to the underlying data source.
In this sample FlexGrid.DataSource property and DataFilter.DataSource property are both set to the same data collection.
That allows to filter FlexGrid content based on multiple conditions selected in the C1DataFilter.
The DataFilter supports methods for saving and loading expressions to XML file.
Autogenerated ChecklistFilter doesn't know what object properties it should use to show content or to perform filtering.

It is application responsibility to clarify these settings using ChecklistFilter binding API:

* The DisplayMemberPath property sets a path to a value on the source object to serve as the visual representation of the object.
* The ValueMemberPath sets a path to a value on the source object to serve as the value representation of the object.
