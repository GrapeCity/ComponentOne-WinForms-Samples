DataBound
-----------------------------
Shows an example of binding C1TileControl to a data source.

A tile element is generated for each row in the associated DataTable
(except those skipped in the FilterItem event). You can map data
columns to the properties of the autogenerated Tile components. If
some columns contain cryptic foreign key values (such as
Product.SupplierID), use the Lookup property of the PropertyMapping
object to replace those values with meaningful strings (such as
Supplier.Country) from another table or data source.
