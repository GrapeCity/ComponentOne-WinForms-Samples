____
A tile element is generated for each row in the associated DataTable (except those skipped in the FilterItem event). You can map data columns to the properties of the autogenerated Tile components. If some columns contain cryptic foreign key values (such as Product.SupplierID), use the Lookup property of the PropertyMapping object to replace those values with meaningful strings (such as Supplier.Country) from another table or data source.
