FileExplorer
-----------------------------
The sample allows browsing the files and folders on the local drives.

There are two C1TileControl in this sample. One is used as the
scrollable toolbar and the other shows individual items, such as drives
and folders. Each type of the item has the special tile template. For
example, the drive's tile template shows a progress bar using the
Template.Paint event (to visualize the available space on the drive).
