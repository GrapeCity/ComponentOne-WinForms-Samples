#### Simulates Windows 8 "All Apps" screen and allows to choose the color scheme.

The sample demonstrates new features of C1TileControl, such as the Template.Enabled property that allows, for example, to display sub-group captions among the clickable tiles.
Also, it shows the new HotBackColor and CheckBackColor properties that offer one more way to highlight the hovered and checked tiles 
(it updates the tile's background color instead of displaying the special border).
