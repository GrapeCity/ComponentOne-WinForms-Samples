TileLayout
-----------------------------
The sample shows various methods of laying out the template elements.

Tiles and templates are the most important components of C1TileControl.
Tile provides the data, template provides the visualization pattern.
You can switch templates for the same tile. For example, the first
template may show the tile image and the second may show the detailed
tile text. Also, you can apply the same template to multiple tiles.

Templates may consist of three possible elements: panel, text, and
image. Panels may contain child elements including nested panels.
There are a number of layout settings that give you full freedom in
laying out the template elements. The sample shows a few layouts.
